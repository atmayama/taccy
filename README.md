# Taccy

fancier middle child of Tic-Tac-Toe (just kidding ðŸ˜œ)

- just an attempt at building a P2P tic-tac-toe game.
- uses peerjs to build the network.
- connects to peers with closest path. if there is any,
- need access to internet only until connection is established.
- Try this:

  - create a hot-spot from one device and connect another device to it.
  - keep both devices connected to internet through mobile network.
  - open https://atmayama.github.io/taccy/
  - click on connect.
  - copy the ID from one device and join from another.
  - once you see the Tic-Tac-Toe layout on both devices, you can switch off the mobile network and go offline.
  - you will still be able to play the game and have fun ðŸ¤©.
  - Magic ðŸª„? Yah kinda.
